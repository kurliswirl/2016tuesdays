As we set up our homes, we think “How long will I be able to stay here?” Every day, many of our family's die fighting for freedom and justice. Every second 150 acres of animals homes are ripped away, and the animals with them. Our homes where we grew up, where our ancestors grew up, gone in an instant. One day your children are laughing by the fire, the next day, your home, your family, all gone, before you can even realize it. How can you still say you are fighting for the right cause if we can't even fight back? How can you even call yourselves humans if you can cut down anything in your way without even thinking “Is this the right thing?
