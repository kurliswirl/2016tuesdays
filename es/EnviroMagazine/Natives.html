    In this article, we will still be focusing on the special about the Amazon rainforest. This time, we will be talking about how deforestation affects the usually forgotten native Amazonians who were in the forest centuries before the criminal mastermind ranchers, loggers. We will be talking to some native Amazonia she who have experienced deforestation and near destruction of their homes.

    First we will talk about how the government affects these drastic changes in these people’s lives. In one particular tribe, who were just recently introduced to society by ranchers burning a large block of land near their tribal grounds. A quote from Emily Linstrom clearly states how angry she is about this: “Us the natives are trying to be peaceful during all of this but when they come at us with guns we have to have self defense, but they see it as trying to kill them first,” Emily Linstrom, native Amazonian. There have been many incidents when there have been violent feuds with the natives. Emily, Theresa and Christina’s tribe have now joined this debate to argue for keeping the amazon the way it is.They very strongly believe that the government, even though they say that they want everyone to be equal, you can clearly see that the government is taking sides with the deforesters. We have also spoken to a government official named Misiki Baruah to hear her thoughts on the matter, “they[native Amazonians]should have the most land because they were there before anyone else,” a lot of people agree with what she just said.They have even just ‘forgotten’ about the uncontacted tribes out there and just say, they don't exist, let's clear the land for the ranchers. That’s what happened with the uncontacted tribe run by Emily, Theresa, and Christina. Many tribes like these felt similar ways with the government. Pretty much all ani-deforestation people are feeling this way about the government.

    The cattle ranchers, are a big factor in this debate too. Some people think of themselves before saving the lives of others. They want money too much. There have been incidents where ranchers and loggers come across the native’s land. They tell them to get out of the way and they refuse because they were there first. The deforesters take out their guns and violence occurs. This happens a lot of the time and needs to stop. People are proposing to set aside land for the Amazonians so this won’t happen again. Though things might get better, they will never be the same for the native Amazonians.

    <br>
    In conclusion, There have been many struggles with the Native Amazonians who seek peace, and there will be more, but hopefully we will overcome this.
