    Welcome to the special edition of Environmagazine where we will focus on the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Obviously, there are many reasons why the rainforest is in such disrepair, but a few notable environmental criminals are ranchers, loggers, and settlers.
    <br>
<br>
    We will first focus on the ranchers. Ranching, which, in the Amazon, produces soybeans and cow byproducts, in a year, produces $1.9 billion. Tourism in Brazil produces $6.6 billion. If the Amazon was destroyed, ecotourism funds would decrease, and Brazil could potentially go bankrupt. Another reason why the ranchers need to stop is because of the number of vegetarians in one city in Brazil is 15 million, whereas, there were around 60,000 ranchers in the developed areas in the Amazon in 2016. Many people are vegetarian around Brazil, and, with the the fund decrease and with the growing number of vegetarians around the world, recently proven by CEO Elsie Salkever, ranching in the developed areas of the Amazon has become increasingly pointless.
    <br>

    The next people who we will discuss are the loggers. Surprisingly, the loggers do not account for a large amount of Amazon deforestation, but any deforestation is horrible. Previously, loggers were just a side thought, when they would back at the trees with chainsaws or axes, and it could take up to an hour to cut a single tree, and workers could only be at work from dawn to dusk. Now, workers have created machines that can cut trees in as little as 5 seconds per tree. This can be a serious problem, because, aside from having an easier time cutting trees, workers can easily attach fluorescent lights to their machines, allowing them to work twenty-four hours. Also, although they replant trees, there are increasingly numbers of forest fires and pollution around the world, so the trees might not fully develop. Also, trees can take incredible amounts of time to fully regrow, up to thousands of years.
<br>
<br>
    The last topic of interest is settlers. Although they don't have a job to destroy the forest, they do. They buy the land and farm on it for a better, “cheaper” life. They are destroying the Amazon, and, because of the tourism rates, they are slowly destroying Brazilian economy. The settlers also depend on clean water for bathing, drinking, and for their animals, as most of them are farmers. If the Amazon was cut down, Brazil would need to pay $93 billion for clean water costs. This would bring down the Brazilian government, who are the only people who can back up the projects supporting the people of each position on the development of the Amazon. The settlers are not even helping Brazilians in any way, unlike the other people, who, with their destruction, who are beneficial a little bit.
    <br>
    <br>
    In conclusion, we can obviously tell that the Amazon is being destroyed in too many ways. Many ways that are unimaginable and horrendous. We hope you consider taking a stand in any court case against any of these groups filled with superficial elements bumping through their selfish minds. Many do not consider what what they are actually doing when they think about having a nice fire or eat some steak.
