Everyday, we have a chance to change our community. Whether it's small things, like walking to school, or big things like organizing a protest against deforestation. No matter how big what you want to do is, if we all make a change, we can slow climate change.
    <br>
<br>
Some things you can do are:
    <ol>
        <li>Transportation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Walk or bike to close places</li>
                <li>Use electric cars</li>
                <li>Use more public transportation and car pools</li>
             </ul>
            Cutting down on gas run cars produces less greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. This helps slow down the "greenhouse effect", which traps heat in out atmosphere and causes global warming.
        <li>In your environment</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Plant trees</li>
                <li>Alternative energy sources</li>
                <li>Recycle</li>
                <li>Use energy efficient appliances</li>
            </ul>
             Doing all of the things above reduces carbon dioxide as well, so factory's do less work, your everyday materials no longer produce green house gases, and also trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen, which humans need to breathe.
           <li>To stop deforestation</li>
        <ul>
                <li>Protest Deforestation</li>
                <li>Use less paper and other wood based supplies</li>
                <li>Buy recycled products</li>
                <li>Eat vegetarian</li>
              </ul>
                        The things above stop deforestation by taking action against it, or reducing the need for empty land for ranching and wood.

            </ol>
        <br>
    As you can see, there are many ways to help climate change. We can do some of these things everyday, and some go above and beyond. Whatever it is, you are helping your planet and your future, by creating more oxygen and slowing the "greenhouse affect".
