<i>Founding-
We were founded in 2016 by activist and CEO of EnviroTek, Naomi Goldstein. A small newsletter was sent out to Newton, and, eventually, the business grew until a web designer and photographer were hired, and business boomed. We now have an extremely large cult following, and we have impacted the environment by suggesting change to our readers.
