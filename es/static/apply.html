    You finish aplplying and learn you have won! As your going to bed, you smell smoke.
    You realize there is a fire in the kitchen. You wake your family and you all get out safely.
    Unfortunately, you lose your house and belongings. Because your family does not believe in
    banks and keeps your money in your house, you lose all that too.
    Luckily, because of your walk on role, people notice your acting ability. You are offered a lot of
    jobs and become a star with billions. You live a great life.
