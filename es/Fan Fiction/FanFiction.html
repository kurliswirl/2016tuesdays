    was this middle-aged guy in a motorized
    <input type="text" name="motorizedTransport">Noun</input>
    . He had thinning hair and a scruffy

beard and a
    <input type="text" name="JacketType">Adjective</input>
    tweed jacket, which always smelled like coffee. You wouldn't think he'd be cool, but
he told stories and jokes and let us play games in class. He also had this awesome collection of Roman
armor and
    <input type="text" name="romanCollectible">Noun</input>
, so he was the only teacher whose class didn't put me to sleep.
I hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn't get in trouble.
Boy, was I wrong.
    <br>
    <br>
See, bad things happen to me on
    <input type="text" name="tripType">Noun</input>
 trips. Like at my fifth-grade school, when we went to the Saratoga
battlefield, I had this accident with a Revolutionary War cannon. I wasn't aiming for the school
    <input type="text" name="SchoolTransportation">Noun</input rows="1" cols="3">
, but of course I got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school, when we took a behind the-scenes
tour of the Marine World
    <input type="text" name="Animal pool">Animal</input>
    pool, I sort of hit the wrong lever on the catwalk and our
class took an unplanned swim. And the time before that... Well, you get the idea.
This trip, I was determined to be good.

    <br>
All the way into the
    <input type="text" name="">Place</input>
    , I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the
    <input type="text" name="NancyBobofit">Person Description</input>
, hitting
my best friend Grover in the back of the head with chunks of
    <input type="text" name="foodProjectile">Food</input>
 butter-and-ketchup sandwich.
Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He must've been held back
several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a
    <input type="text" name="weirdBeards">Adjective</input>
 beard on his
chin. On top of all that, he was crippled. He had a note excusing him from PE for the rest of his life
because he had some kind of muscular disease in his
    <input type="text" name="muscularDisease">Body Part</input>
. He walked funny, like every step hurt him, but
don't let that fool you. You should've seen him run when it was
    <input type="text" name="gourmetSchoolCaf">Food</input>
 day in the cafeteria.</font></p>
