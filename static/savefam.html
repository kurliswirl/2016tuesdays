    You finish your homework and start going to bed. As your going to bed, you smell smoke.
    You realize there is a fire in the kitchen. You wake your family and you all get out safely.
    Unfortunately, you lose your house and belongings. Because your family does not believe in
    banks and keeps your money in your house, you lose all that too.
    Your family goes into poverty, and you
    never go to collage because your family lost all their money.
